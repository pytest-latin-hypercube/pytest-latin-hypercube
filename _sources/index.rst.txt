pytest-latin-hypercube documentation
====================================

This is the documentation for `pytest-latin-hypercube`, a python package designed to run pytest tests using a Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) strategy.
This strategy involves testing every possible parameter value at least once, rather than testing every possible combination of parameter values.

The goal of this project is to allow for more efficient testing of code by reducing the number of tests that need to be run, while still maintaining a high level of confidence.
